# HARQIS Workflows: Give me a *kiss*

# Description
- A **kiss** (*key integration synchronous script*) in a unit of an automated process or workflow that performs a series of tasks navigating thru multiple apps.
- Data and information is passed from one application to another from various implementations like (but not limited to) API chaining, data store and access using data models and/or scraping.
- As described, a single unit synchronous, but can be part of a larger asynchronous process.
- The package core fixtures and utilities supports ease of use and maintainability.
- A **kiss** can be triggered by a schedule, an event or a manual action.
- Similar feature to an applet in IFTTT or a zap in Zapier.
