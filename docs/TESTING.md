# HARQIS in Action: A Generic Project Testing Boilerplate
- This documentation aims to provide a ready-to-use test project template, complete with a detailed guide for implementing testing processes that are specifically tailored to your project's context.
- By leveraging the [**HARQIS-core**](../README.md) components, this template offers an initial project structure that is not only highly extensible but also effortlessly adapts to the evolving demands of your project.

## Key Objectives
### Generate A Project Testing Checklist
Create a comprehensive checklist to ensure all essential components are included when starting a testing project.  These are grouped into the following core categories along with best practices and guidelines that can be applied:

| Category                                                       | Description                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Testing Strategy**](../docs/testing/STRATEGY.md)            | Formulate a robust testing strategy that outlines the methodology, tools, and lifecycle to be employed.                               |
| [**Test Processes**](../docs/testing/PROCESSES.md)             | Develop and establish a comprehensive set of processes for analyzing requirements, planning tests, developing test cases, and more.   |
| [**Test Tooling**](../docs/testing/TOOLING.md)                 | Identify and implement appropriate tools for both frontend and backend automation testing, test data mocking, and other requirements. |
| [**Managing Stakeholders**](../docs/testing/STAKEHOLDERS.md)   | Effectively classify stakeholders, align ways of working, and communicate quality assurance expectations and progress.                |

### Setup A Initial Project Documentation Structure
Create a project documentation structure that can be easily adapted to meet the specific requirements of the project from the above categories.

## Benefits
- **Consistent and Simplified Approach**: Offers a streamlined method to navigate new projects in terms of testing approach and demands.
- **Modular Documentation**: Provides flexible strategy and process documentation that can be updated and adjusted to meet specific testing requirements.
- **Principles and Standards**: Ensures quality and consistency by implementing established testing principles and standards.
- **Out-of-the-Box Technology Stack**: Utilizes core components to provide a foundational technology stack for testing.
- **Scalable Test Effort**: Enhances the scalability and efficiency of test efforts, facilitating easier management and execution across multiple projects.
- **Enhanced Governance**: Improves governance across projects, provides clear documentation, and effectively manages stakeholders' expectations.
- **Increased Visibility**: Boosts the visibility of test strategies and promotes collaboration and feedback among team members.
