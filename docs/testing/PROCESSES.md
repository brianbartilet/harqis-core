# Testing Processes
- This document outlines the test processes that needed to be established for a project.
- This would be very valuable for day to day testing activities and would be a good reference for the team to follow.
- Each task is broken down into subtasks, target documentation to be generated and related concepts to provide a comprehensive guide for formulating a testing strategy.
