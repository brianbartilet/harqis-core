I will start by extracting the contents of the uploaded files to understand the structure and data they contain. Let's begin by extracting the contents of the files.
I have extracted the contents of the uploaded zip files. Here are the extracted directories:
- `specs`: Contains the extracted contents from the specs zip file.
- `generated`: Contains the extracted contents from the generated zip file.
- `mustache`: Contains the extracted contents from the mustache zip file.

Next, I will explore the extracted directories to understand their structure and contents.
The extracted files in each directory are as follows:

**Specs Directory:**
- `base_service.py`
- `config.py`
- `config.yaml`
- `__init__.py`
- `models/new_task.py`
- `models/new_workflow.py`
- `models/task.py`
- `models/workflow.py`
- `models/__init__.py`
- `services/tasks.py`
- `services/workflows.py`
- `services/__init__.py`
- `tests/tasks.py`
- `tests/workflows.py`
- `tests/__init__.py`

**Generated Directory:**
- `app-debug.log`
- `app.log`
- `generate.py`
- `transform_helper.py`
- `__init__.py`
- `models/config_yaml.py`
- `models/models.py`
- `models/service.py`
- `models/test.py`
- `models/__init__.py`
- `templates/base_service.mustache`
- `templates/config.mustache`
- `templates/config_yaml.mustache`
- `templates/models.mustache`
- `templates/service.mustache`
- `templates/test.mustache`
- `templates/__init__.py`

**Mustache Directory:**
- `tasks_api_specs.yaml`

Next, I will proceed with generating a Python data dictionary that contains integration and negative test cases based on the provided mustache templates and fixtures.
I will now create a Python data dictionary that contains integration and negative test cases based on the provided mustache templates and fixtures. Let's generate the data dictionary and save it to a text file for download.
I have created the Python data dictionary containing the integration and negative test cases based on the provided mustache templates and fixtures. The data has been saved to a text file.

You can download the generated Python data dictionary from the following link:

I will read the content of the uploaded files to understand the data structure and then proceed with generating the Python dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
It seems that there was an issue with reading the uploaded files due to encoding errors. Let me try reading the files with a different encoding to resolve this problem.
The content of the uploaded files seems to be in a binary format, likely compressed files (ZIP files). Let me extract the contents of these files to further analyze the data structure.
It seems that the content of the uploaded files is in a string format, while the `ZipFile` function requires a bytes-like object. Let me convert the content to bytes and then try to extract the files again.
It seems that there was an error while trying to decompress the files. The error indicates an issue with the compression format. Let me try to read the files without decompressing them to understand their structure.
It seems that there are issues with reading the uploaded files as ZIP archives. Let me try to read the content of the files directly to understand their structure.
The content of the uploaded files is still in a binary format. Let me try to extract the files directly without decompressing them to understand their structure.

I will start by extracting the contents of the uploaded files to understand the data structure and then proceed to generate the Python dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
It seems that the file `tasks_api_specs.yaml` is not present in the extracted folder. Let me check the contents of the folder to identify the correct file path.
The `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file is not present in the extracted folder. Let me check the contents of the folder to identify the correct file path.
It seems that the `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file is not present in the extracted folder. Let's proceed by examining the contents of the other uploaded files to understand the data structure and generate the Python dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
The contents of the `generated` folder include Python scripts (`generate.py`, `transform_helper.py`), log files, and subfolders for models and templates. Let's proceed by examining the contents of the `mustache` folder.
The `mustache` folder contains the `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file. Let's load the contents of this file to understand the data structure and proceed with generating the Python dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
The `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file contains OpenAPI specifications for a simple task API, including paths for listing tasks, creating tasks, getting a task by ID, listing workflows, and creating workflows. It also defines schemas for tasks, new tasks, workflows, and new workflows.

Now, I will proceed with generating the Python dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
The Python dictionary for integration test cases has been successfully generated based on the OpenAPI specifications. It includes test cases for listing tasks, creating tasks, getting a task by ID, listing workflows, and creating workflows.

Next, I will proceed with generating the Python code for the integration test cases and negative test cases based on the given mustache templates and fixtures.
It seems I forgot to import the `pystache` library to render the mustache template. Let me correct that and generate the Python code for the integration test cases.
It seems that the `pystache` library is not available in this environment. Let me try an alternative method to generate the Python code for the integration test cases.

```python

I will start by extracting the contents of the uploaded files to understand the structure and data they contain. Let's begin by extracting the contents of the files.
The extracted files are organized as follows:

### Specs Directory:
- `base_service.py`
- `config.py`
- `config.yaml`
- `__init__.py`
- `models`
- `services`
- `tests`

### Generated Directory:
- `app-debug.log`
- `app.log`
- `generate.py`
- `transform_helper.py`
- `__init__.py`
- `models`
- `templates`
- `__pycache__`

### Mustache Directory:
- `tasks_api_specs.yaml`

Next, I will read the content of the `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file to understand its structure and data. Let's proceed with that.
It seems that the `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file is not present in the `specs` directory. Let me check the contents of the `mustache` directory to ensure we have the correct file path.
The `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file is indeed present in the `mustache` directory. Let's read the content of this file to understand its structure and data.
The content of the `tasks_api_specs.yaml` file provides the OpenAPI specifications for a simple Task API. It includes paths for listing tasks, creating tasks, getting a task by ID, listing workflows, and creating workflows. Additionally, it defines schemas for tasks, new tasks, workflows, and new workflows.

Next, I will proceed with generating a Python data dictionary that contains integration and negative test cases based on the provided mustache templates and fixtures. I will then save this generated data in a text file for download. Let's start by creating the Python data dictionary.
I will now generate the Python data dictionary containing integration and negative test cases based on the provided mustache templates and fixtures. Let's proceed with this task.
The Python data dictionary containing integration test cases has been successfully created based on the provided example data. The next step is to generate negative test cases based on boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning. Let's proceed with generating the negative test cases.
The negative test cases have been successfully generated based on boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning for the integration test cases. Each negative test case inverts the expected HTTP status code for testing error scenarios.

Next, I will save the Python data dictionary to a text file for download. Let's proceed with that.
The Python data dictionary containing integration and negative test cases has been successfully generated and saved to a text file. You can download the file using the following link:
